SUBCORPORA 2 - my work from other coursesÊ
oduction In 2014, the dollar exchange rate skyrocketed in my home country Colombia, for long, it was everything I could hear in the news; everyone seemed to be frightened about it. It appeared that a costly dollar was extremely unfavorable for Colombia; many claimed it was a setback for the economy's development. I grew up repeating these statements without understanding why it was "bad", but now that I'm aware of my country's economic situation, I want to understand the reasons behind this common idea. For context, during 2019, $1US dollar was about COP3.500. But, as shown in Figure 1, five years before (2014), figures were very different; the average cost of 1US$ was COP2,000. Figure 1. Line graph illustrating the price of the dollar in Colombian pesos (y-axis). Taken from www.dolar-colombia.com This phenomenon is explained by the offer and demand theory; during 2014, there were many dollars available in the country (mainly because of the costly brent barrel); hence, it was cheaper. But because of the Saudi Arabia price war, the barrel was low-priced and fewer dollars entered Colombia, making the US$ increase. Because the dollar price is such a big concern for Colombians, in my report, I aim to investigate to what extent is a low representative market rate (TRM1 ) beneficial for Colombia's economy? 1 TRM for its initials in Spanish. 3 To better understand the TRM fluctuation, for my first engagement activity, I contacted some of the most prominent and knowledgeable people in the matter. They were: Camilo Vega, recognized economist and reporter from "El Espectador" and "Dinero" (two of the most influential magazines in Colombia). Ramiro Giraldo, a financial engineer at a senior position in Proteccion Sura, where he is continuously overviewing the TRM change and its implications for the business. And Carlos Forero, a noteworthy businessman directly affected by the TRM's fluctuation as he owns several companies that import and export products. These interviews gave me a deeper understanding and different perspectives of how Colombia's economy works -not only regarding the dollar-, they answered questions that came up as I went deeper into the issue. Overall, I spent three hours talking to them, and due to the huge contributions these individuals had on the elaboration of this essay, they will be cited throughout it. The general public's perspective is fundamental for this topic. Thus, for my second engagement activity, I conducted a survey with over 100 people from different socio-cultural and economic backgrounds to assess their perspectives over the dollar fluctuation for the country's and their personal finances. The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions and an openended question for participants to thoroughly discuss their opinions. Later on, I had informal conversations with 14 of them2 to discuss their answers. I elaborated all pie charts shown in this essay with the answers obtained from my survey. 2 Via phone call due to Covid-19 restrictions. 4 Figure 2. Pie chart for one of the answers to my survey. Own elaboration Body The average Colombian sees the most ponderous negative effect of a high TRM. Colombia's economy is extensively dependent on larger economies like the US and China. "Many products consumed in the country use imported raw materials" (C. Forero, personal communication, April 19, 2020). Most of these supplies come from countries, such as those mentioned above. Therefore, when dollar increases, the same number of articles in equal quantities are more expensive for national industries as most of the global transactions are made in US$. When talking to those surveyed who owned companies in my survey, they expressed they continuously monitor the TRM tendency to see when is the best time to buy dollars and pay international debts, so they don't have to greatly increase the final price to the consumer. This is backed up by data provided by the DIAN, which reported that "during march 2018 and march 2019, the food supply sector imported products worth 7,171,308 thousand US$, which corresponds to 13,78% of the total imports of the country" (DIAN, 2020)Ñ a considerable percentage of the food consumed in Colombia comes from outside of it. Hence, when the TRM increases, people spend more COP to cover the same necessities, which is negatively perceived 5 by the general population as proven by the results obtained from my survey, where 63% of those directly affected by the TRM reported being negatively impacted by it. Figure 3. Pie chart from my survey when those who reported being directly impacted by dollar were asked how they were affected. Own elaboration As seen during last years, a constant dollar increase can be a driving force for inflation. Many of the basic food basket (bfb) products, such as corn, lentils, and rice, are imported. Thus, a high TRM reflects in a more expensive bfb and the annual increase in the minimum salary is based -among other things- on the bfb price, so if it increases, the minimum wage follows, which will make inflation rates higher. This is another reason why Colombians feels an expensive dollar hurts the economy: they base their opinions on personal experience and perceive that when the dollar increases, the primary need products they usually buy -those in the bfb- also go up, leading to a negative perspective of a costly USD$. This was evident in the survey, where a whopping 93% of those interviewed believed a high TRM harmed the overall Colombian economy. 6 Figure 4. Pie chart showing the answers when all participants were asked about the impact of a high TRM. Own elaboration. Additionally, the livestock sector is distressed, as the products used to feed porks and poultry are imported. Santiago Piedrahita, head of one of Colombia's biggest animal feed producers, stated that "for every 100 pesos that the dollar increases, the cattle feed becomes 2% more expensive" (As cited by Dinero, 2019). During the phone calls of my second engagement activity, most of them expressed their concern about the rising food prices and how low-income families are forced to buy less animal protein because of their costs. As a consequence of a more expensive bfb, inflation occurs, making all products more expensive while the minimum wage does not follow at the same rate. The previous examples demonstrate that high TRM negatively impacts the industries depending on imported raw materials. "80% of the total importations are products used by other industries" (Monterrosa, 2020). As production cost increase, the additional price is passed onto the final consumer. Consequently, Colombians purchasing capacity decreases as they need to pay more COP for the same product. Relating this to what was studied during this global politics syllabus, I noticed this leads to a macroeconomic impact. Development is slowed down due to a 7 decrease in consumption, the local economy may experience a setback leading to a slow growth rate, which may be seen as a warning sign for international investors, who opt not to invest in Colombian companies due to the quiet peace of growth. Some materials aren't produced locally because they are not cost-efficient as they are not technified compared to international competitors. While discussing this with Forero, we came up with an example to easily illustrate this, suppose national companies see an empty niche that the overseas business can no longer cover because the products they offer are too expensive (as they have to be imported with a high dollar). In those cases, local companies might invest in machinery to make their production facilities more technified and competitive. Consequently, some raw materials will be bought locally, promoting a protectionism economy while increasing GDP. On the other hand, companies exporting their products but producing them in Colombia with predominantly local raw materials are hugely benefited when TRM rises. ÒThe trade is made in US$, thus even if they receive the same amount of dollars, their profit -when measured in COP- will be higherÓ (C. Forero, personal communication, April 19, 2020). Most of their expenses, such as workforce, are paid for in pesos, and when the TRM is elevated, they can pay more people with fewer dollars. This promotes employment, which is a way to decrease the inequality gap. If more individuals are employed, they will consume more, and the process will repeat, which creates an economic activation. Moreover, this can make local businesses more competitive in the global market because they can lower their prices and still be profitable as fewer US$ make up for the same amount of pesos. The last, increase the demanded products' internal production, making more money circulate the country's economy. As a result, the overall 8 GDP -an indicator of the country's wealth- will go up, making more international investors see Colombia as a safe country for their assets. Yet, when the TRM is low, many businesses outside the country become interested in selling their products across our borders as citizens are capable of buying more dollars. Consequently, local brands have higher competition and may not sell the volume they once expected to. Leaking takes place, as some of the profit exits the country, which does not contribute to GDP growth. Such was the case of Coltejer, a Colombian textile company that was sold to a Mexican corporation because they were not able to compete with the textiles coming from China and India. Throughout my interviews with Camilo, I realized that the changing TRM is logically a concern for the government. External debt is paid for in US$, and as it gets higher, the government -which earns in COP- has to spend a bigger part of the revenue paying for such debt. As explained by Vega, "when TRM increases, the republic has fewer pesos available for carrying out all other activities that were meant to improve the citizens' quality of life and foster country's development" (Vega, personal communication, May 28, 2020). A higher percentage of the GDP is destined to pay the capital and interests of the loans. Hence the designed rate for education, health, infrastructure, among others, might be reduced. Many loans were acquired when the TRM was COP2.300. Now that it has skyrocketed to reach a historical maximum of COP 4.1533 , the government will have to make severe adjustments to the budget distribution. During 2019, "public external debt was 73.835 million dollars" (DIAN, 2020), reflecting as 22.8% of the GDP reported for that year. In a personal communication, Ramiro Giraldo highlighted the dependence 3 March 20, 2020 9 our economy has on the dollar is so significant that "the National Bank has some dollars reserved in case it has to inject them to the Colombian market to lower the TRM." (R. Giraldo, May 3, 2020). Figure 6. Colombia's External Debt as a Percentage of the GDP, 2009-2018. Taken from www.ceicdata.com with data retrieved from the National Bank. My engagement activities and researches led me to think that Colombia is more attractive to big multinationals seeking to outsource their production because workforce, utilities, and leases are paid for in COP. If these companies outsource their production to Colombia (strategically located for exports/imports), GDP will increase, meaning a bigger budget available for healthcare, roads, education, among others. The former generates jobs and provides citizens with the possibility of specializing in subjects related to the work, allowing them to be eligible for high-paid positions (workforce specialization). This strategy's economic potential is enormous. It has the capability of boosting the government's income. Still, to do so, the government has to control terrorism, corruption and have stable economic and industrial laws. If such conditions are not met, it is not likely that big corporations will move their operations to Colombia. 10 The general public's perspective originally made me believe an expensive dollar was unfavorable for everyone in Colombia (including the government). But after engaging in conversation with people able to support their claims with evidence, it is now clear that it is not entirely bad for the economy as a whole, just that the immediate consequences of raising TRM harm most Colombians finances at a personal level. Yet, they benefit the industry and service sector, which in the long term will help the workers and, subsequently, a great percentage of the general public. I noticed that the 7% of those that in my survey stated a high TRM benefited Colombia's economy (see Figure 4), were mainly people who owned businesses or were literate in economic and finance fields. Bellow, some of the participantÕs answers. Figure 7. Some of answers given by participants when asked how they were affected by the TRM fluctuation. Own elaboration based in data collected from my survey. Conclusion Engaging in this essay hugely broaden my perspective about the interconnectedness of modern societies. An issue I initially thought only to be affected by internal factors turned out to be influenced by a variety of situations happening in the global scenario. I also realized it is not an exclusively economic issue but a combination of political, social, and international matters. Even though the public view considers a high TRM is terrible for the state's finance when judging it from a macroeconomic outlook, it is beneficial for Colombia's economy. It fosters local production of materials that are too expensive to import, promotes domestic consumption, and allows some of Colombia's industries, such as coffee, avocado, and petroleum, to be more 11 competitive in the global market. Thus, even if fewer dollars enter the country, more COP will be available, making up for the increased living cost. This results in GDP growth, which, combined with a high TRM, makes Colombia more attractive to international corporations seeking to outsource their productions or entrepreneurs seeking new places to invest, leading to higher employment and more companies paying taxes to Colombian authorities. By far, there are more positive consequences of a high TRM than adverse effects, yet, in order to see the bright side, there must be some state guarantees as security and stable laws to ensure new business (local and international) can thrive, generating new jobs for Colombians and improving the economy, which on the long term creates a better life quality
Defining a field of interest:Ê
My field of interest in the publishing industry as an author/writer/storyteller.Ê
- Niche:
Young adults from 20 - 28 that resonates with the content I share through my writing - I donÕt have a genre to define what it is that I want to share since itÕs still a work in progress, IÕm learning and still defining lots of things in my journey as a woman, as an immigrant, as a human and as a writer; along the lines of bettering oneself and connecting to your highest potential through energy and introspection.
- Mission statement:
To be able to bring light to existing doubts, to create new doubts in people that bring realizations, to share my story and create empathy through healing, you never know if what youÕre going through and what focus you give to it is what somebody else needs to solve their own issue.Ê

~What:~ My oserviceo is sharing my thoughts, being open to discussion and helping others, to allow a nice reading moment that gives my readers a nice time and introspection opportunities.
~Ho I solve their problem- they say you never find books, books find you. I firmly believe that ll be the case whenever I publish my first, second, third and as many books as life allows me to share with my readers, whether it is a one time connection or creating a community that are moved and pushed to be better, to feel better and do better after having my input (even in an indirect way)Ê
~Why:~ I should be hired as junior writer and what makes me different from my competitors is I donÕt mind failing, I donÕt mind making a fool of myself neither I think of thinking what is ÒcorrectÓ - I say what I say and itÕll bring the consequences that has to come to me.Ê
I think finding writers who say things as they are and not influenced to go by trends and by what you should be saying is hard, I love books that slap me right in the face and forces me to acknowledge when thereÕs a problem, when someone describes feelings IÕm ashamed to recognize I have.Ê
No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader, right?

Regarding the Jeff BezoÕs quote on: your personal branding is what people say about you when youÕre not in the room; I could sell myself and bring up all the things I know my friends say about me, I could list all my qualities and accomplishments.Ê
I prefer to say what people that donÕt like me say about me, cause they can say lots of things, but being a bad human being, being someone harmful to others will never be one of them, I believe in true human nature, human nature that looks for community, human nature that makes mistakes - I can be intimidating cause I tend to go through life with a mix of I donÕt care attitude and an I care too much attitude at the same time.Ê
I donÕt pay much attention to what is said about me, nobody knows my whole story to make an unbiased judgement of who I am and what I do, not even me.Ê
We are all constant work in progress, changing and evolving, IÕm always open to growth, to hear different and opposite perspectives from my beliefs and actions, core values will always stay the same.

Live like a girl, not so fun when itÕs not about throwing a ball. Recent news, for months now, has been blasting in all social media platforms in hand with its users the current ongoing situation in Iran after a 22-year-old woman, Masha Amani, passed away after being heavily beaten up by ÒMorality policeÓ for wearing an incorrectly her mandatory hijab. This situation provoked not only a national scandal and common indignation but when Iranians raised their voice and called for help from everyone in the world to do so when their government shut all telecommunications to stop this issue from being known, the news was all over the place with the alliance and indignation from everyone who knew the story; in the article ÒWoman, Life, FreedomÓ (which is also the slogan of this national/worldwide revolution against the repressive Islamic regimen) by Souza, Lind, Parashar, Prul & Zalewski, they mention how the men who lead this regimen Òdeclared women's lives to be worth half those of menÓ. This is not just indignant to read as a woman, but the fact that with or without religion, womanÕs life being seen as something with little to no value, the fear that gives every woman who walks alone at night, every woman who has received some sort of punishment for not following rules imposed by men who wonÕt let go of the control over womenÕs life, every woman who was forced to remain silent, every woman who has been abused or assaulted one more reason to raise their voices, to feel the great sisterhood thatÕs been growing over the past years and to break the patriarchy system that has kept us so quiet and submissive to start the end of this. This same regimen has been resisted by Iranian women over the past 40 years (Erfani, 2020; Hasani 2017), when making a worldwide call to gender politics in a country that sees womenÕs life as not valuable, where they canÕt live as a normal human being with rights and obligations, in a society where they only have obligations that benefit only the men who own them, it is hard not to move something among societies that even with sexism present in their culture, some advance has been made and some stories have been buried. This is not a religious issue, it is not only an Islamic issue, is a worldwide and history long issue that weÕve been all fighting to stop and at the same time, too busy to care until itÕs someone close to you or until it's top trending on social media, until thereÕs not any more pretexts to ignore it. When talking about feminicides, which is the killing of a woman or girl, in particular by a man and on account of her gender; is so hard for some people to realize and so easy for the government to hide, that sexism and misogyny is reason enough for men to just kill women, that the justice system has done nothing but ignore the huge purple elephant in the room, by trying to add those murders to the pile of closed and non-investigated cases, rather than acknowledge there is a cultural and social issue that is affecting not only women but the values of society itself. From a personal experience, I come from a third world country where tacos are great and insecurity for woman is huge, Mexico, where 10 woman are killed a day and a girl/woman is assaulted every 7 minutes (Souza, 2021), IÕm part of that 97% and part of that 36% that survived the attack. Skyler Glenn mentions in her article Ò97% invalidatedÓ, the data that IÕm sure most of us know: ÒA recent study shows that 97% of UK women aged 18-24 have experienced some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime. Social media users are using this statistic irresponsibly and invalidating victims.Ó This exact number might vary for each country, point is, at least 90% of women in most countries has suffered some kind of harassment or abuse, whether it is Middle Eastern, Europeans or Latin American cultures, this is a human type of problem, nonetheless the culture, religion, development, etcÉ It is clear that there are not just apologies and improvements to be done to the feminine gender and the survivors of attacks, violence, and forced silence. Equality and equity in genders is something that feminist movements have been fighting since the 1800s, women should have all the rights to live any way they want to, not just because we are women, and it even feels absurd to be clarifying this, but because we are human beings too, we shouldnÕt be dividing ourselves based on gender. The sexist belief that weÕre baby machines and stay-at-home maids to be used and thrown away once we donÕt look pretty enough or that weÕre not tight enough has to stop. The saying Òboys will be boysÓ when theyÕre disgusting and inappropriate has to stop. We, as a society need to own up for our clear marked patterns in gender policies and division and make a change, we as the next generation of change makers need to wake up, the solution is not on those lame 6 second videos we spend hours on. We don't ask to be more, we ask to be recognized for what we are, and what we are worth, which is literally the same as a man, we ask for equal pay, we ask for reproductive rights, and the power of making decisions over our bodies, we fight to we are fighting for so much right now that sometimes is hard to know where to begin, how to make a positive and impactful change individually, what is important is to raise future generations these issues and teach them better, to stand up for what is right and always always respect everyone regardless their gender, we are woman, we are nurturing energy, we are powerful and unstoppable.

Thesis: Does the compulsive consumption of different forms of media literacy affect our and future generations' attention spans? Media Literacy has brought lots of benefits for our society on all sorts of levels: education-wise, quick distribution of information on important subjects that need to be known nationally and/or internationally (i.e- "Women's Life Freedom" in Iran, bans and injustices of women's rights in Afghanistan, etc), new forms of entertainment, to mention a couple. It has also become something available to most people, regardless of their race, gender, or social class; even the cheapest cellphone nowadays tend to be smartphones with the capability of downloading different social media platforms/mass media news coverage applications plus the inevitable ads and marketing campaigns which we are forced to be surrounded by, not to forget the broad internet that may be accessed through many devices (laptop, pc, tablet, smartphones, tv, radio). Foremost, to recognize both extremes of this stand view in media literacy and the effects of it, negative and positive effects in our daily life, as individuals and as a media literate society; various studies have been done regarding this change in our attention span (ref. 5) and compare the benefits of being able to get the resources and abilities, considering they are at the time that learning for younger generations and being able to complete the communication cycle: communicating to the receiver, for the receiver to be able to provide feedback and opinions regarding the message sent and the sender being able to correct and/or acknowledge the message being re-received. And the cons of it, the loss of interest in mastering any subject, the loss of interest in reading whole books, the loss of interest in anything outside the screen we seem to have our face glued to, so pretty much the loss of interest of doing the hard work of learning differently than what we have right now. But how are we learning now? And is it as efficacious and better compared to the old ways of dealing with the need to get information? Media Literacy has many forms of manifestation, as it is involved with some of our senses, visuals and sound through mentioned devices; While its use for personal growth or community engagement turns out to be one of the most substantial achievements in technology, it has altered our ability to focus for a prolonged time due to constant overload of information daily. Social media platforms switched their algorithms into pushing and giving priority to videos and content that are no longer than 15 to 30 seconds, hence, the conditioning of instant gratification of getting all the information. Some of them being informative and/or educational, tend to be more energy and time-consuming for the compulsive consumerism template we blindly follow nowadays in one way or another, more like a distraction if we do not pay close attention to what we consume and actively custom our feed into positive and limited use of it. We have conditioned ourselves and the communication system into using our devices at any plausible moment. We have become puppets of a system where every like, follow and social media interaction measures in a way a percentage of how we value our ÒworthinessÓ. With media literacy's latest forms of communication and the modification of old ways of expressing ourselves and creating new terms (E.g- slang) for behaviours, we have created this new way of interacting, sending and receiving information. Such as FOMO: ÒFear of Missing Out is defined by The New York Times as 'the blend of anxiety, inadequacy and irritation that can flare up while skimming social mediaÕ.Ó (ref. 2) where the messages if not tricky or even false when sharing our lives, this is where the new needs of instant gratification and consumption are born, whether they are feeling the pressure to Òbe likeÓ, Òhave a life-likeÓ, Òhave the things likeÓ. Going back to the attention span reduction problem, thereÕs a new term for the effect this system is having on us known as ÒThe Goldfish EffectÓ explained in (ref.3) ÒNational Centre for Biotechnology Information claimed that the average human attention span has dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds in 2013 (just one second below that of a goldfish).Ó This is a consequence of not only the short and useless content we mindlessly consume; how easy it is now to get any piece of knowledge of pretty much anything with any google search, so thereÕs no interest anymore in becoming an expert on anything if you just need singular facts of something. This effective, quick and easy method of getting pretty much anything out of the various platforms gives us a constant supply of dopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for the feeling of wellness and happiness, which weÕve become addicted to, altering the natural chemical supply in our brains, which makes us constantly look for that instant rush of dopamine and has made us lazy to a certain extent to force ourselves to focus in anything that gives us that same gratification feeling, like a book. On a side note, I would like to mention that there are many factors outside of the over-usage of electronic devices and different platforms where media literacy plays a part, mental health issues, and normal struggles in a period of anybodyÕs life. Ashrof. mentions this in his article, Impact Of Social Media On Our Attention Span And Its Drastic Aftermath: ÒMany working professionals suffer from attention discrepancies; some physical and mental health issues can contribute to abbreviated attention spans, including poor diet, lack of exercise, and conditions such as depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Ó (ref.2) What is important is not to ban or have extreme control measures to avoid the loss of our ability to focus and organically pay attention to other channels of information receiving but to create a culture of consciousness on what, when, how much and why we consume what we do, to create the habit of being aware of our screen times and the quality of that use. I donÕt pretend to say that none of the ÒuselessÓ content out there is completely that, useless. Funny videos of cats make a bad day a good one for anybody. Just as in every aspect of our lives, balance is key, and working towards the center of this duality between the benefits and opportunity costs weÕre letting go of by spending hours interacting in social media and the internet consumption cycle we are trapped in. It is very important that as a literate society with this whole bunch of information about this issue inside those same platforms, be conscious and stop scrolling through TikTok videos and Instagram reposts of those same videos mindlessly. ThatÕs a term IÕve used a couple of times now in this essay, what I mean by ÒmindlessÓ is that we tend to use this popular and now normalized behaviour to escape from our outside-of-the-screen problems, people disassociate while scrolling and we are all desperate of finding that instant gratification routine that we cannot seem to escape from because some of us do not know we are in it and some others do not care since the consequences of losing the ability to focus and be present do not sound as important as watching the YouTube video where Donald Trump's hair looks funny. I would consider this research and acknowledge this to be a wake-up call, for me, my generation and future generations, to use these advanced technologies in our favour instead of letting them use us, use our time, our energy, and summing it all together, our life.

Reading Questions:
1) What are two examples of reasons that Daniel Solove provides (in ÒPrivacy
SelfManagement and the Consent DilemmaÓ) for thinking that consent wonÕt adequatelyprotect privacy?While the language is complex and no one really has time or energy to read through all the paperwork, people donÕt usually take the time (or has the time) to micro-manage thewhole privacy settings for each privacy and terms agreement.2) What do Solon Barocas and Helen Nissenbaum think is the relationship betweenanonymity and privacy, and why?
They say that is a bypass for the data processing without names, itÕs a good alternative for
certain challenges that some privacy terms donÕt say clearly. ItÕs a good alternative until a
certain extent since everything can be tracked down to an IP address or profile or address
that eventually will reveal the identity of the ÒanonymousÓ person.
Discussion Question
To what extent can consent and anonymization address privacy concerns? When are they
sufficient, and when might other measures be necessary? Why?
I think that consenting without regulation opens the door to non-anonymity, even when you think you are we donÕt really know until what extent or under which circumstances the
anonymity will continue, at the end of the day we are all numbers in a huge pool of datathat might have outliers in it that for national security but for marketing purposes the downside is really negative if we think of the manipulation behind to and the abuse ofinformation that people donÕt realize is giving up.

How do MRI scanners work?
10818157
Ê
When discussing the applications of physics, it is hard to ignore the profound importance that it has in medicine. With the National Health service (NHS) having a budget of £176.5 bn in 20211, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an essential technique used in diagnostic medicine. The MRI scanner works on a quantum mechanical basis, taking advantage of spin and electromagnetism. This essay will discuss the structure of the scanner, how the scanner utilises spin, and how nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) gives an image.

Classically, angular momentum is a property associated with rotating objects. In quantum mechanics the particle is not rotating but the spin has an associated angular momentum. Unlike in classical mechanics, where angular momentum interacts with the gravitational field, a quantum particle with spin interacts with the magnetic field and can only take discrete eigenstates which are spin up or spin down. Hydrogen atoms are available in abundance in the human body as there are 2 hydrogen atoms associated with every water molecule2. A charged particle with spin can create a magnetic field that forms a similar field pattern as a bar magnet.Ê The nucleus of a hydrogen atom is a proton with a magnetic moment induced by the spin. This describes the strength and orientation of the proton. The magnetic moment aligns with the magnetic field of the MRI. Precession about the magnetic field of the scanner occurs, given by the Larmor equation:
Ê
Ê

(1)
whereÊ is the spin precession,Ê is a constant known as the gyromagnetic ratio and depends on the nucleus andÊ is the magnetic field strength. Normally, the protons are orientated in random directions, but alignment of nuclear spins occurs in the presence of an external magnetic field.Ê
Ê
The MRI scanner is made up of 3 main parts: a super conducting magnet, gradient coils and radio frequency (RF) coils. The outermost layer consists of a superconducting magnet which is around 60,000 times stronger than the earthÕs magnetic field3 and transfers electrons without resistance. This interacts with the protons. The gradient coils pass current through them by FaradayÕs law,

Ê
producing its own magnetic field in the three spatial directions. WhereÊ is the voltage,Ê is the number of coils,Ê is the flux andÊ is time. The radiographer manipulates the magnetic field using gradient coils in the x, y and z directions, allowing the production of a 3D image. The final layer includes RF coils which detect the magnetic resonance signals from the precessing hydrogen atoms. Since the proton acts like a bar magnet, the magnetic flux changes sinusoidally at the precession frequency and induces a potential difference by faradayÕs law (equation 2).
Ê
The MRI is an application NMR that uses radiowaves to probe the water molecules in the human body. When the spin frequency is equal to the larmor frequency (equation 3), constructive superposition occurs, and the proton moves to a higher energy spin state. Upon its return to the ground state, an RF signal is released and detected by the RF coils and an exponential decay is observed, which is known as free induction decay. The total magnetic field is the sum of the vector field in one direction and the detected NMR signal comes from billions of spins.
Ê
Due to the influence of overlapping magnetic fields from neighbouring atoms, the spin rates change slightly and over time atoms no longer precess in the same direction. The T2 or the transverse relaxation is the time taken for spinning protons to go out of phase with each other. The T1 time (or longitudinal relaxation) measures the time taken for the protons to align with the external magnetic field. The T1 and T2 time depends on the biological make up of different tissues. Fluid tissue (e.g. water and blood) have higher T2 values than other tissues (e.g. fat and proteins), because energy exchange is less efficient when molecules are further apart, so the rate of decay occurs slower. Each tissue in the body will have itsÕ own unique relaxation time, allowing the radiographers to distinguish various tissues in the body. When atoms are tipped out of phase with each other the magnetic field starts the process of realignment and over time enough signal and data is collected to form a detectable image.
Ê
The MRI can be a great tool in diagnostic medicine. It is relatively low risk, compared to the ionising radiation exposure during an X-Ray or CT scanner. Historically, low-field MRI scanners were used clinically (0.35T). Nowadays a strong magnetic field (1.5T and 3T5) is used. There is a positive correlation between field strength and quality of image and ultimately this contributes to the high cost of the MRI ($1 million to $3 million6). The use of a powerful magnet has limitations on patients with certain metal implants, such as pacemakers, cochlear implants etc. Certain protocol must be undergone to ensure their safety, for example reprogramming the pacemaker after the scan. Furthermore, certain metallic implants can distort the magnetic field and create a lower quality image. In Ohio State University, researchers have developed MRI technology that utilises a lower magnetic field to overcome this image distortion4. Ultimately, technological advancements could produce higher quality images at lower field strengths, thus increasing the accessibility to these procedures while reducing the cost.

The MRI scanner alone has seen great success in the medical industry with roughly 4 million patients having a scan with the NHS between September 2018 to 20197. Although there are drawbacks to using them, when considering patients with implants. Ultimately the scanner has provided life-saving diagnosis around the world, due to the importance of physics, and in particular quantum physics, in medicine.
