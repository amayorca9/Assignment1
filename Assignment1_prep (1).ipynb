      "oduction In 2014, the dollar exchange rate skyrocketed in my home country Colombia, for long, it was everything I could hear in the news; everyone seemed to be frightened about it. It appeared that a costly dollar was extremely unfavorable for Colombia; many claimed it was a setback for the economy's development. I grew up repeating these statements without understanding why it was \"bad\", but now that I'm aware of my country's economic situation, I want to understand the reasons behind this common idea. For context, during 2019, $1US dollar was about COP3.500. But, as shown in Figure 1, five years before (2014), figures were very different; the average cost of 1US$ was COP2,000. Figure 1. Line graph illustrating the price of the dollar in Colombian pesos (y-axis). Taken from www.dolar-colombia.com This phenomenon is explained by the offer and demand theory; during 2014, there were many dollars available in the country (mainly because of the costly brent barrel); hence, it was cheaper. But because of the Saudi Arabia price war, the barrel was low-priced and fewer dollars entered Colombia, making the US$ increase. Because the dollar price is such a big concern for Colombians, in my report, I aim to investigate to what extent is a low representative market rate (TRM1 ) beneficial for Colombia's economy? 1 TRM for its initials in Spanish. 3 To better understand the TRM fluctuation, for my first engagement activity, I contacted some of the most prominent and knowledgeable people in the matter. They were: Camilo Vega, recognized economist and reporter from \"El Espectador\" and \"Dinero\" (two of the most influential magazines in Colombia). Ramiro Giraldo, a financial engineer at a senior position in Proteccion Sura, where he is continuously overviewing the TRM change and its implications for the business. And Carlos Forero, a noteworthy businessman directly affected by the TRM's fluctuation as he owns several companies that import and export products. These interviews gave me a deeper understanding and different perspectives of how Colombia's economy works -not only regarding the dollar-, they answered questions that came up as I went deeper into the issue. Overall, I spent three hours talking to them, and due to the huge contributions these individuals had on the elaboration of this essay, they will be cited throughout it. The general public's perspective is fundamental for this topic. Thus, for my second engagement activity, I conducted a survey with over 100 people from different socio-cultural and economic backgrounds to assess their perspectives over the dollar fluctuation for the country's and their personal finances. The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions and an openended question for participants to thoroughly discuss their opinions. Later on, I had informal conversations with 14 of them2 to discuss their answers. I elaborated all pie charts shown in this essay with the answers obtained from my survey. 2 Via phone call due to Covid-19 restrictions. 4 Figure 2. Pie chart for one of the answers to my survey. Own elaboration Body The average Colombian sees the most ponderous negative effect of a high TRM. Colombia's economy is extensively dependent on larger economies like the US and China. \"Many products consumed in the country use imported raw materials\" (C. Forero, personal communication, April 19, 2020). Most of these supplies come from countries, such as those mentioned above. Therefore, when dollar increases, the same number of articles in equal quantities are more expensive for national industries as most of the global transactions are made in US$. When talking to those surveyed who owned companies in my survey, they expressed they continuously monitor the TRM tendency to see when is the best time to buy dollars and pay international debts, so they don't have to greatly increase the final price to the consumer. This is backed up by data provided by the DIAN, which reported that \"during march 2018 and march 2019, the food supply sector imported products worth 7,171,308 thousand US$, which corresponds to 13,78% of the total imports of the country\" (DIAN, 2020)Ñ a considerable percentage of the food consumed in Colombia comes from outside of it. Hence, when the TRM increases, people spend more COP to cover the same necessities, which is negatively perceived 5 by the general population as proven by the results obtained from my survey, where 63% of those directly affected by the TRM reported being negatively impacted by it. Figure 3. Pie chart from my survey when those who reported being directly impacted by dollar were asked how they were affected. Own elaboration As seen during last years, a constant dollar increase can be a driving force for inflation. Many of the basic food basket (bfb) products, such as corn, lentils, and rice, are imported. Thus, a high TRM reflects in a more expensive bfb and the annual increase in the minimum salary is based -among other things- on the bfb price, so if it increases, the minimum wage follows, which will make inflation rates higher. This is another reason why Colombians feels an expensive dollar hurts the economy: they base their opinions on personal experience and perceive that when the dollar increases, the primary need products they usually buy -those in the bfb- also go up, leading to a negative perspective of a costly USD$. This was evident in the survey, where a whopping 93% of those interviewed believed a high TRM harmed the overall Colombian economy. 6 Figure 4. Pie chart showing the answers when all participants were asked about the impact of a high TRM. Own elaboration. Additionally, the livestock sector is distressed, as the products used to feed porks and poultry are imported. Santiago Piedrahita, head of one of Colombia's biggest animal feed producers, stated that \"for every 100 pesos that the dollar increases, the cattle feed becomes 2% more expensive\" (As cited by Dinero, 2019). During the phone calls of my second engagement activity, most of them expressed their concern about the rising food prices and how low-income families are forced to buy less animal protein because of their costs. As a consequence of a more expensive bfb, inflation occurs, making all products more expensive while the minimum wage does not follow at the same rate. The previous examples demonstrate that high TRM negatively impacts the industries depending on imported raw materials. \"80% of the total importations are products used by other industries\" (Monterrosa, 2020). As production cost increase, the additional price is passed onto the final consumer. Consequently, Colombians purchasing capacity decreases as they need to pay more COP for the same product. Relating this to what was studied during this global politics syllabus, I noticed this leads to a macroeconomic impact. Development is slowed down due to a 7 decrease in consumption, the local economy may experience a setback leading to a slow growth rate, which may be seen as a warning sign for international investors, who opt not to invest in Colombian companies due to the quiet peace of growth. Some materials aren't produced locally because they are not cost-efficient as they are not technified compared to international competitors. While discussing this with Forero, we came up with an example to easily illustrate this, suppose national companies see an empty niche that the overseas business can no longer cover because the products they offer are too expensive (as they have to be imported with a high dollar). In those cases, local companies might invest in machinery to make their production facilities more technified and competitive. Consequently, some raw materials will be bought locally, promoting a protectionism economy while increasing GDP. On the other hand, companies exporting their products but producing them in Colombia with predominantly local raw materials are hugely benefited when TRM rises. ÒThe trade is made in US$, thus even if they receive the same amount of dollars, their profit -when measured in COP- will be higherÓ (C. Forero, personal communication, April 19, 2020). Most of their expenses, such as workforce, are paid for in pesos, and when the TRM is elevated, they can pay more people with fewer dollars. This promotes employment, which is a way to decrease the inequality gap. If more individuals are employed, they will consume more, and the process will repeat, which creates an economic activation. Moreover, this can make local businesses more competitive in the global market because they can lower their prices and still be profitable as fewer US$ make up for the same amount of pesos. The last, increase the demanded products' internal production, making more money circulate the country's economy. As a result, the overall 8 GDP -an indicator of the country's wealth- will go up, making more international investors see Colombia as a safe country for their assets. Yet, when the TRM is low, many businesses outside the country become interested in selling their products across our borders as citizens are capable of buying more dollars. Consequently, local brands have higher competition and may not sell the volume they once expected to. Leaking takes place, as some of the profit exits the country, which does not contribute to GDP growth. Such was the case of Coltejer, a Colombian textile company that was sold to a Mexican corporation because they were not able to compete with the textiles coming from China and India. Throughout my interviews with Camilo, I realized that the changing TRM is logically a concern for the government. External debt is paid for in US$, and as it gets higher, the government -which earns in COP- has to spend a bigger part of the revenue paying for such debt. As explained by Vega, \"when TRM increases, the republic has fewer pesos available for carrying out all other activities that were meant to improve the citizens' quality of life and foster country's development\" (Vega, personal communication, May 28, 2020). A higher percentage of the GDP is destined to pay the capital and interests of the loans. Hence the designed rate for education, health, infrastructure, among others, might be reduced. Many loans were acquired when the TRM was COP2.300. Now that it has skyrocketed to reach a historical maximum of COP 4.1533 , the government will have to make severe adjustments to the budget distribution. During 2019, \"public external debt was 73.835 million dollars\" (DIAN, 2020), reflecting as 22.8% of the GDP reported for that year. In a personal communication, Ramiro Giraldo highlighted the dependence 3 March 20, 2020 9 our economy has on the dollar is so significant that \"the National Bank has some dollars reserved in case it has to inject them to the Colombian market to lower the TRM.\" (R. Giraldo, May 3, 2020). Figure 6. Colombia's External Debt as a Percentage of the GDP, 2009-2018. Taken from www.ceicdata.com with data retrieved from the National Bank. My engagement activities and researches led me to think that Colombia is more attractive to big multinationals seeking to outsource their production because workforce, utilities, and leases are paid for in COP. If these companies outsource their production to Colombia (strategically located for exports/imports), GDP will increase, meaning a bigger budget available for healthcare, roads, education, among others. The former generates jobs and provides citizens with the possibility of specializing in subjects related to the work, allowing them to be eligible for high-paid positions (workforce specialization). This strategy's economic potential is enormous. It has the capability of boosting the government's income. Still, to do so, the government has to control terrorism, corruption and have stable economic and industrial laws. If such conditions are not met, it is not likely that big corporations will move their operations to Colombia. 10 The general public's perspective originally made me believe an expensive dollar was unfavorable for everyone in Colombia (including the government). But after engaging in conversation with people able to support their claims with evidence, it is now clear that it is not entirely bad for the economy as a whole, just that the immediate consequences of raising TRM harm most Colombians finances at a personal level. Yet, they benefit the industry and service sector, which in the long term will help the workers and, subsequently, a great percentage of the general public. I noticed that the 7% of those that in my survey stated a high TRM benefited Colombia's economy (see Figure 4), were mainly people who owned businesses or were literate in economic and finance fields. Bellow, some of the participantÕs answers. Figure 7. Some of answers given by participants when asked how they were affected by the TRM fluctuation. Own elaboration based in data collected from my survey. Conclusion Engaging in this essay hugely broaden my perspective about the interconnectedness of modern societies. An issue I initially thought only to be affected by internal factors turned out to be influenced by a variety of situations happening in the global scenario. I also realized it is not an exclusively economic issue but a combination of political, social, and international matters. Even though the public view considers a high TRM is terrible for the state's finance when judging it from a macroeconomic outlook, it is beneficial for Colombia's economy. It fosters local production of materials that are too expensive to import, promotes domestic consumption, and allows some of Colombia's industries, such as coffee, avocado, and petroleum, to be more 11 competitive in the global market. Thus, even if fewer dollars enter the country, more COP will be available, making up for the increased living cost. This results in GDP growth, which, combined with a high TRM, makes Colombia more attractive to international corporations seeking to outsource their productions or entrepreneurs seeking new places to invest, leading to higher employment and more companies paying taxes to Colombian authorities. By far, there are more positive consequences of a high TRM than adverse effects, yet, in order to see the bright side, there must be some state guarantees as security and stable laws to ensure new business (local and international) can thrive, generating new jobs for Colombians and improving the economy, which on the long term creates a better life quality\n",

      "Live like a girl, not so fun when itÕs not about throwing a ball. Recent news, for months now, has been blasting in all social media platforms in hand with its users the current ongoing situation in Iran after a 22-year-old woman, Masha Amani, passed away after being heavily beaten up by ÒMorality policeÓ for wearing an incorrectly her mandatory hijab. This situation provoked not only a national scandal and common indignation but when Iranians raised their voice and called for help from everyone in the world to do so when their government shut all telecommunications to stop this issue from being known, the news was all over the place with the alliance and indignation from everyone who knew the story; in the article ÒWoman, Life, FreedomÓ (which is also the slogan of this national/worldwide revolution against the repressive Islamic regimen) by Souza, Lind, Parashar, Prul & Zalewski, they mention how the men who lead this regimen Òdeclared women's lives to be worth half those of menÓ. This is not just indignant to read as a woman, but the fact that with or without religion, womanÕs life being seen as something with little to no value, the fear that gives every woman who walks alone at night, every woman who has received some sort of punishment for not following rules imposed by men who wonÕt let go of the control over womenÕs life, every woman who was forced to remain silent, every woman who has been abused or assaulted one more reason to raise their voices, to feel the great sisterhood thatÕs been growing over the past years and to break the patriarchy system that has kept us so quiet and submissive to start the end of this. This same regimen has been resisted by Iranian women over the past 40 years (Erfani, 2020; Hasani 2017), when making a worldwide call to gender politics in a country that sees womenÕs life as not valuable, where they canÕt live as a normal human being with rights and obligations, in a society where they only have obligations that benefit only the men who own them, it is hard not to move something among societies that even with sexism present in their culture, some advance has been made and some stories have been buried. This is not a religious issue, it is not only an Islamic issue, is a worldwide and history long issue that weÕve been all fighting to stop and at the same time, too busy to care until itÕs someone close to you or until it's top trending on social media, until thereÕs not any more pretexts to ignore it. When talking about feminicides, which is the killing of a woman or girl, in particular by a man and on account of her gender; is so hard for some people to realize and so easy for the government to hide, that sexism and misogyny is reason enough for men to just kill women, that the justice system has done nothing but ignore the huge purple elephant in the room, by trying to add those murders to the pile of closed and non-investigated cases, rather than acknowledge there is a cultural and social issue that is affecting not only women but the values of society itself. From a personal experience, I come from a third world country where tacos are great and insecurity for woman is huge, Mexico, where 10 woman are killed a day and a girl/woman is assaulted every 7 minutes (Souza, 2021), IÕm part of that 97% and part of that 36% that survived the attack. Skyler Glenn mentions in her article Ò97% invalidatedÓ, the data that IÕm sure most of us know: ÒA recent study shows that 97% of UK women aged 18-24 have experienced some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime. Social media users are using this statistic irresponsibly and invalidating victims.Ó This exact number might vary for each country, point is, at least 90% of women in most countries has suffered some kind of harassment or abuse, whether it is Middle Eastern, Europeans or Latin American cultures, this is a human type of problem, nonetheless the culture, religion, development, etcÉ It is clear that there are not just apologies and improvements to be done to the feminine gender and the survivors of attacks, violence, and forced silence. Equality and equity in genders is something that feminist movements have been fighting since the 1800s, women should have all the rights to live any way they want to, not just because we are women, and it even feels absurd to be clarifying this, but because we are human beings too, we shouldnÕt be dividing ourselves based on gender. The sexist belief that weÕre baby machines and stay-at-home maids to be used and thrown away once we donÕt look pretty enough or that weÕre not tight enough has to stop. The saying Òboys will be boysÓ when theyÕre disgusting and inappropriate has to stop. We, as a society need to own up for our clear marked patterns in gender policies and division and make a change, we as the next generation of change makers need to wake up, the solution is not on those lame 6 second videos we spend hours on. We don't ask to be more, we ask to be recognized for what we are, and what we are worth, which is literally the same as a man, we ask for equal pay, we ask for reproductive rights, and the power of making decisions over our bodies, we fight to we are fighting for so much right now that sometimes is hard to know where to begin, how to make a positive and impactful change individually, what is important is to raise future generations these issues and teach them better, to stand up for what is right and always always respect everyone regardless their gender, we are woman, we are nurturing energy, we are powerful and unstoppable.

      "Thesis: Does the compulsive consumption of different forms of media literacy affect our and future generations' attention spans? Media Literacy has brought lots of benefits for our society on all sorts of levels: education-wise, quick distribution of information on important subjects that need to be known nationally and/or internationally (i.e- \"Women's Life Freedom\" in Iran, bans and injustices of women's rights in Afghanistan, etc), new forms of entertainment, to mention a couple. It has also become something available to most people, regardless of their race, gender, or social class; even the cheapest cellphone nowadays tend to be smartphones with the capability of downloading different social media platforms/mass media news coverage applications plus the inevitable ads and marketing campaigns which we are forced to be surrounded by, not to forget the broad internet that may be accessed through many devices (laptop, pc, tablet, smartphones, tv, radio). Foremost, to recognize both extremes of this stand view in media literacy and the effects of it, negative and positive effects in our daily life, as individuals and as a media literate society; various studies have been done regarding this change in our attention span (ref. 5) and compare the benefits of being able to get the resources and abilities, considering they are at the time that learning for younger generations and being able to complete the communication cycle: communicating to the receiver, for the receiver to be able to provide feedback and opinions regarding the message sent and the sender being able to correct and/or acknowledge the message being re-received. And the cons of it, the loss of interest in mastering any subject, the loss of interest in reading whole books, the loss of interest in anything outside the screen we seem to have our face glued to, so pretty much the loss of interest of doing the hard work of learning differently than what we have right now. But how are we learning now? And is it as efficacious and better compared to the old ways of dealing with the need to get information? Media Literacy has many forms of manifestation, as it is involved with some of our senses, visuals and sound through mentioned devices; While its use for personal growth or community engagement turns out to be one of the most substantial achievements in technology, it has altered our ability to focus for a prolonged time due to constant overload of information daily. Social media platforms switched their algorithms into pushing and giving priority to videos and content that are no longer than 15 to 30 seconds, hence, the conditioning of instant gratification of getting all the information. Some of them being informative and/or educational, tend to be more energy and time-consuming for the compulsive consumerism template we blindly follow nowadays in one way or another, more like a distraction if we do not pay close attention to what we consume and actively custom our feed into positive and limited use of it. We have conditioned ourselves and the communication system into using our devices at any plausible moment. We have become puppets of a system where every like, follow and social media interaction measures in a way a percentage of how we value our ÒworthinessÓ. With media literacy's latest forms of communication and the modification of old ways of expressing ourselves and creating new terms (E.g- slang) for behaviours, we have created this new way of interacting, sending and receiving information. Such as FOMO: ÒFear of Missing Out is defined by The New York Times as 'the blend of anxiety, inadequacy and irritation that can flare up while skimming social mediaÕ.Ó (ref. 2) where the messages if not tricky or even false when sharing our lives, this is where the new needs of instant gratification and consumption are born, whether they are feeling the pressure to Òbe likeÓ, Òhave a life-likeÓ, Òhave the things likeÓ. Going back to the attention span reduction problem, thereÕs a new term for the effect this system is having on us known as ÒThe Goldfish EffectÓ explained in (ref.3) ÒNational Centre for Biotechnology Information claimed that the average human attention span has dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds in 2013 (just one second below that of a goldfish).Ó This is a consequence of not only the short and useless content we mindlessly consume; how easy it is now to get any piece of knowledge of pretty much anything with any google search, so thereÕs no interest anymore in becoming an expert on anything if you just need singular facts of something. This effective, quick and easy method of getting pretty much anything out of the various platforms gives us a constant supply of dopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for the feeling of wellness and happiness, which weÕve become addicted to, altering the natural chemical supply in our brains, which makes us constantly look for that instant rush of dopamine and has made us lazy to a certain extent to force ourselves to focus in anything that gives us that same gratification feeling, like a book. On a side note, I would like to mention that there are many factors outside of the over-usage of electronic devices and different platforms where media literacy plays a part, mental health issues, and normal struggles in a period of anybodyÕs life. Ashrof. mentions this in his article, Impact Of Social Media On Our Attention Span And Its Drastic Aftermath: ÒMany working professionals suffer from attention discrepancies; some physical and mental health issues can contribute to abbreviated attention spans, including poor diet, lack of exercise, and conditions such as depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Ó (ref.2) What is important is not to ban or have extreme control measures to avoid the loss of our ability to focus and organically pay attention to other channels of information receiving but to create a culture of consciousness on what, when, how much and why we consume what we do, to create the habit of being aware of our screen times and the quality of that use. I donÕt pretend to say that none of the ÒuselessÓ content out there is completely that, useless. Funny videos of cats make a bad day a good one for anybody. Just as in every aspect of our lives, balance is key, and working towards the center of this duality between the benefits and opportunity costs weÕre letting go of by spending hours interacting in social media and the internet consumption cycle we are trapped in. It is very important that as a literate society with this whole bunch of information about this issue inside those same platforms, be conscious and stop scrolling through TikTok videos and Instagram reposts of those same videos mindlessly. ThatÕs a term IÕve used a couple of times now in this essay, what I mean by ÒmindlessÓ is that we tend to use this popular and now normalized behaviour to escape from our outside-of-the-screen problems, people disassociate while scrolling and we are all desperate of finding that instant gratification routine that we cannot seem to escape from because some of us do not know we are in it and some others do not care since the consequences of losing the ability to focus and be present do not sound as important as watching the YouTube video where Donald Trump's hair looks funny. I would consider this research and acknowledge this to be a wake-up call, for me, my generation and future generations, to use these advanced technologies in our favour instead of letting them use us, use our time, our energy, and summing it all together, our life.

      "When discussing the applications of physics, it is hard to ignore the profound importance that it has in medicine. With the National Health service (NHS) having a budget of £176.5 bn in 20211, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an essential technique used in diagnostic medicine. The MRI scanner works on a quantum mechanical basis, taking advantage of spin and electromagnetism. This essay will discuss the structure of the scanner, how the scanner utilises spin, and how nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) gives an image.\n",

      "Classically, angular momentum is a property associated with rotating objects. In quantum mechanics the particle is not rotating but the spin has an associated angular momentum. Unlike in classical mechanics, where angular momentum interacts with the gravitational field, a quantum particle with spin interacts with the magnetic field and can only take discrete eigenstates which are spin up or spin down. Hydrogen atoms are available in abundance in the human body as there are 2 hydrogen atoms associated with every water molecule2. A charged particle with spin can create a magnetic field that forms a similar field pattern as a bar magnet.Ê The nucleus of a hydrogen atom is a proton with a magnetic moment induced by the spin. This describes the strength and orientation of the proton. The magnetic moment aligns with the magnetic field of the MRI.

The T2 or the transverse relaxation is the time taken for spinning protons to go out of phase with each other. The T1 time (or longitudinal relaxation) measures the time taken for the protons to align with the external magnetic field. The T1 and T2 time depends on the biological make up of different tissues. Fluid tissue (e.g. water and blood) have higher T2 values than other tissues (e.g. fat and proteins), because energy exchange is less efficient when molecules are further apart, so the rate of decay occurs slower. Each tissue in the body will have itsÕ own unique relaxation time, allowing the radiographers to distinguish various tissues in the body. When atoms are tipped out of phase with each other the magnetic field starts the process of realignment and over time enough signal and data is collected to form a detectable image.\n",

      "The MRI can be a great tool in diagnostic medicine. It is relatively low risk, compared to the ionising radiation exposure during an X-Ray or CT scanner. Historically, low-field MRI scanners were used clinically (0.35T). Nowadays a strong magnetic field (1.5T and 3T5) is used. There is a positive correlation between field strength and quality of image and ultimately this contributes to the high cost of the MRI ($1 million to $3 million6). The use of a powerful magnet has limitations on patients with certain metal implants, such as pacemakers, cochlear implants etc. Certain protocol must be undergone to ensure their safety, for example reprogramming the pacemaker after the scan. Furthermore, certain metallic implants can distort the magnetic field and create a lower quality image. In Ohio State University, researchers have developed MRI technology that utilises a lower magnetic field to overcome this image distortion4. Ultimately, technological advancements could produce higher quality images at lower field strengths, thus increasing the accessibility to these procedures while reducing the cost.\n",

      "The MRI scanner alone has seen great success in the medical industry with roughly 4 million patients having a scan with the NHS between September 2018 to 20197. Although there are drawbacks to using them, when considering patients with implants. Ultimately the scanner has provided life-saving diagnosis around the world, due to the importance of physics, and in particular quantum physics, in medicine.\n",

      "TEL AVIV Ñ Amid a tumult of grief and calls for vengeance, one victim has offered a remarkableÊ Ñ and controversial Ñ gesture of peace toward the captors and killers who tore through her community.\n",
      "Yocheved Lifshitz] , 85, one of the Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas, was being released late Monday when, according to footage released by the militant group, she turned to one of the armed, balaclava-clad militants, shook the personÕs hand and uttered one word: ÒshalomÓ Ñ a Hebrew salutation meaning Òpeace.Ó\n",
      "\n",
      "ÒI went through hell,Ó Lifshitz said back at a hospital in Tel Aviv early Tuesday.\n",
      "Her captors beat her in the ribs with sticks, she said, making it difficult to breathe. She was visibly exhausted and physically worn. But she told reporters that she offered the handshake because the Hamas militants Òwere gentle with usÓ while she was imprisoned in theÊ [Òspider webÓ of tunnels] under the Gaza Strip.\n",
      "Lifshitz said the fighters, whose group is banned as a terrorist organization in the United States, were Òvery kindÓ and Òtook care of all of our needsÓ Ñ from making sure they were well-fed to cleaning their toilets and looking after their Òfemale hygiene.Ó\n",
      "Israeli officials have condemned the Hamas messaging around her release as nothing more than propaganda, while other observers pointed to the value Hamas may see in treating such a high-profile group of captives with care.Ê\n",
      "ÒThe State of Israel is happy to see the beloved grandmothers at home, and thanks Egypt and the Red Cross for their assistance,Ó the Israeli government said Tuesday. But Òit is important to refer to the media messages coming out of Hamas,Ó it added. ÒThe issue of freedom of speech or press does not exist in Gaza. Hamas makes sure that anyone who deviates from its lines will bear the consequences,Ó it said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lifshitz, a peace activist helping transport Palestinians in Gaza to get treatment in Israeli hospitals, was taken hostage from Nir Oz. The kibbutz about a mile from Gaza was marauded by Hamas militants, who killed or abducted around a quarter of its residents, according to officials. Its isolated position meant it was an easy target for the extremists, who tortured families and burned people alive in their safe rooms, according to first responders who saw the carnage.\n",
      "Her husband, Oded Lifshitz, a journalist and fellow peace activist, is still being held.\n",
      "LifshitzÕs grandson, Daniel, told NBCÕs ÒTODAYÓ show Tuesday that he Òfelt such a huge, huge, huge sting in my heart to see her in that situation, knowing that sheÕs been through so much.Ó But he called for continued international pressure to bring home the more than 200 remaining hostages, adding that seeing his grandmother returned made him Òscared for all the peopleÓ still imprisoned.\n",
      "LifshitzÕs outreach to her Hamas guards will seem beyond charitable to many Israelis. It could not be further from the desire expressed by many here for justice and retribution. The Hamas attack killed more than 1,400 people, a colossal figure in a small country where few if any have escaped grief on some level.\n",
      "But while Israel has responded by bombarding Gaza, killing more than 5,000 people according to Palestinian health officials, it has so far relented from an expected ground invasion. The White House has been urging its regional ally to allow more time for humanitarian aid to enter the strip, as well as talks to free the hostages.\n",
      "A kibbutzim peace activist\n",
      "Even amid this talk of restraint, LifshitzÕs comments make her an outlier and perhaps more representative of the kibbutzim near Gaza, many of whose residents were progressive peace activists like her and more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than many other Israelis.\n",
      "ÒMany are center-left, many are activists, many have relations with Palestinians based on equality,Ó said Louis Fishman, an associate professor at Brooklyn College, and author of ÒJews and Palestinians in the Late Ottoman Era 1908-1914, Claiming the Homeland.ÓÊ\n",
      "If her views are unsurprising for a kibbutzim peace activist, then so is HamasÕ good treatment of its captives, its main bargaining chip, he said.\n",
      "ÒOf course thatÕs the priority of Hamas to take care of them to use in a prisoner exchange or something else,Ó Fishman said. ÒYes, they were treated humanely, but the thing we need to emphasize first is the tragedy of her experience, the trauma she went through.Ó\n",
      "Even before the psychological body blow the surprise Hamas attack dealt to their nation, only 15% of Israeli Jews supported the idea of negotiating with Hamas, according toÊ [polling released only last month by the Mitivim think tank]. The most popular opinion, 30%, was the status quo: military ÒdeterrenceÓ in exchange for Òcalm.ÓÊ\n",
      "ÒTwo decades ago, when there was hope for peace, there was a lot of cross border engagement,Ó said Nimrod Goren, president and founder of Mitivim. ÒThat is gone.Ó\n",
      "Nevertheless, Lifshitz, who along with her neighbor Nurit Cooper, 79, became the third and fourth captives released by Hamas, is not the first victim of terror to reject urges of reprisal.\n",
      "In 1987 Northern Ireland, when an Irish Republican Army bomb killed 11 people including Marie Wilson, 20, her father, Gordon Wilson, told the BBC that he bore Òno grudgeÓ toward her killers and said he would Òpray for those people tonight and every night.Ó\n",
      "He went on to become an internationally renowned peace campaigner, and the incident is seen as a turning point in Òthe TroublesÓ conflict, which ended a decade later.\n",
      "Pushing for an alternative response\n",
      "Likewise in Israel, some of the people who lost most in HamasÕ attack are calling for a different approach.\n",
      "Jonaton Zeigen, son of Vivian Silver, another peace activist also kidnapped in the attack, has been outspoken in disavowing the relentless Israeli bombardment of Gaza, which it says is targeting Hamas but has killed thousands of civilians, many of them children.\n",
      "ÒI also want to yell and scream and kill, and thatÕs the easy, natural sentiment of humans,Ó he said in an interview with NBC News. ÒBut itÕs not the right thing to do.Ó He added that in Gaza Òwe need to stop the violence now. Vengeance is not a strategy. We need to negotiate, we need to get the captives out.Ó\n",
      "Magen Inon, whose parents, Bilha and Yakov Inon, were killed by Hamas, has echoed a similar sentiment.\n",
      "ÒPeople from both sides of the border have good reasons to hate one another,ÓÊ [he wrote last week]. ÒBut this cannot be the only option. My family does not seek revenge.Ó\n",
      "Likewise Yaakov Argamani, whose daughter, Noa Argamani, was filmed being abducted on the back of a motorcycle, said he does Ònot blame anyone.Ó\n",
      "ÒIn Gaza, too, families are mourning their children,ÓÊ [he told IsraelÕs Haaretz newspaper. ÒWhat will a few more deaths achieve?Ó\n",
      "Few if any Israelis would minimize what happened just more than two weeks ago, an event so devastating to the nationÕs sense of security that it will take years to unpack and process. But for now the Lifshitz family seems to be focusing on bringing back more Israelis alive rather than seeking retribution.\n",
      "Every person Òwho comes back is like a ray of light,Ó Daniel Lifshitz said. But single rays were not enough, he added, Òwe also need a sun.Ó\n",

      "The federal complaint alleges that Emerson was engaging in Òcasual conversationÓ with the other pilots, discussing the weather and his career with Alaska Airlines, when he attempted to grab two red engine shutoff handles. Emerson threw his headset across the cockpit and told the pilots ÒI am not OKÓ as he reached for the handles, the complaint said.\n",
      "One of the pilots grabbed EmersonÕs wrists, while the other declared an in-flight emergency. Emerson had to be Òwrestled withÓ for several seconds until he settled down, the pilots told investigators.\n",

      "Emerson said, ÒYou need to cuff me right now or itÕs going to be bad,Ó according to the flight attendants.\n",
      "Flex handcuffs were placed around EmersonÕs wrists. While seated at the back of the plane, he attempted to grab the handle of an emergency exit but was stopped by a flight attendant who placed her hands on top of his, the complaint said.\n",
      "A flight attendant said Emerson made comments like ÒI messed everything upÓ and acknowledged that he put peopleÕs lives at risk.\n",
      "Passengers on Flight 2059, operated by Alaska Airlines subsidiary Horizon Air, lauded the crewÕs quick actions and ability to stop Emerson.\n",
      "ÒI made eye contact with him,Ó passenger Aubrey Gavello said after Emerson was booted from the cockpit and walked to the back of the plane. ÒIt was like one of those soul-chilling, dead in the eyes, just calm and just kind of like he was taking in everyone around him.Ó\n",
      "About 35 minutes after takeoff, a flight attendant ÒfranticallyÓ alerted passengers over the loudspeaker that Òwe have a situationÓ and that the pilots needed to land the plane, Gavello said.\n",

      "Gavello said she saw the flight attendant and a man, who at the time no one knew was an off-duty pilot, walking from the cockpit to the back of the plane.\n",
      "She said the man was in zip ties and the flight attendant was Òtrying to calm him down, saying that we were going to get him on the ground and everything was going to be OK.Ó\n",
      "The man remained seated in the back, Gavello said, and the flight attendant informed the cabin, ÒI just want to let everyone know theyÕre safeÓ and assured the passengers that the plane was not having mechanical issues.\n",
      "ÒHer second announcement calmed everyone down,Ó Gavello said, Òand then we landed.Ó\n",

      "ÒItÕs very scary to know that that person was allowed in the cockpit, in the jump seat, where he was sitting,Ó Wood said.\n",
      "ÒI thought I was being dramatic because I got off the plane and my boyfriend and I werenÕt sitting together, and I was like shaking and he was asleep the whole time, so he didnÕt know,Ó Gavello said. ÒAnd I was like, am I being so dramatic or was that really traumatizing?ÓÊÊ\n",

      "WASHINGTON Ñ Former President Donald Trump is seeking to toss the federal election obstruction case against him, arguing in court filings Monday that his actions are protected by the First Amendment and that he canÕt be tried again after being acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment trial.\n",
      "In court filings filed shortly before midnight, lawyers for Trump argued that the charges against their client are legally faulty, noting CongressÕ unsuccessful efforts to impeach him in the final days of his presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "ÒThe United States Senate has previously tried and acquitted President Trump for charges arising from the same course of conduct alleged in the indictment, the impeachment and double jeopardy clauses both bar retrial before this Court and require dismissal,Ó the filing argues.\n",
      "Special counsel Jack SmithÕs office in August indicted Trump on conspiracy charges to defraud the U.S. by claiming widespread election fraud in the 2020 election in an attempt to overturn Joe BidenÕs electoral victory.\n",
      "The indictment accuses Trump of involvement in three criminal conspiracies: Òto defraud the United States by using dishonesty, fraud and deceitÓ to obstruct the electoral vote process; to Òimpede the January 6 congressional proceeding at which the collected results of the presidential election are counted and certified;Ó and Òagainst the right to vote and to have that vote counted.Ó\n",
      "Ê[The first motion argues that the indictment should be dismissed on various constitutional grounds: First Amendment, double jeopardy and due process.\n",
      "ÒThe First Amendment embraces and encourages exactly this kind of behavior, and therefore states in the clearest of terms that ÔCongress shall make no law É abridging the freedom of speech, É or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances,ÕÓ they wrote in the first motion. ÒThe indictment, taken as true, violates this core principle as to each count. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss the indictment in its entirety.Ó\n",

      "In the second motion, Trump lawyer John Lauro argues the indictment should be dismissed because the prosecution failed to actually lay out how Trump violated the four statutes heÕs charged under.\n",
      "ÓThe prosecution does not explain how President Trump violated these statutes, beyond simply saying he has while regurgitating the statutory language,Ó Lauro writes. ÒAs explained herein, the reason the prosecution employed this tactic is plain Ñ President Trump did not violate the charged statutes, even accepting the prosecutionÕs false allegations as true.Ó\n",
      "The third motion argues the indictment should be dismissed because Trump is being selectively and vindictively prosecuted.\n",
      "\n",
      "ÒThis case, urged by Biden when many prosecutors and agents appropriately saw no basis for it, is a straightforward retaliatory response to President TrumpÕs decisions as Commander In Chief in 2020, his exercising his constitutional rights to free speech and to petition for the redress of grievances, and his decision to run for political office,Ó Lauro wrote.\n",
      "In the third motion, Lauro also asks U.S. District JudgeÊ [Tanya Chutkan to set a hearing date to explore these allegations.\n",
      "ÒHere, at minimum, BidenÕs statements from the White House and leaked accounts of flaws in the underlying investigation require additional fact finding before these arguments can be resolved,Ó he wrote.\n",
      "Separately, Trump also [ filed a motion to strike references to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack from the indictment, arguing that such references are Òprejudicial and inflammatoryÓ since prosecutors donÕt directly blame Trump for the violence.\n",
      "ÒBecause the Government has not charged President Trump with responsibility for the actions at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, allegations related to these actions are not relevant and are prejudicial and inflammatory,Ó Trump attorneys Todd Blanche, John Lauro, Emil Bove and Gregory Singer wrote. ÒTherefore, the Court should strike these allegations from the Indictment.Ó\n",
      "The motions were filed weeks after TrumpÕs legal team argued in a court filing that he should be shielded from prosecution in the 2020 election interference case because of presidential immunity, claiming his efforts to overturn his election loss and remain in the White House were at Òthe heart of his official responsibilities as President.Ó\n",
      "TrumpÕs lawyers refuted the special counselÕs claim that ÒPresident TrumpÕs motives were impure Ñ that he purportedly ÔknewÕ that the widespread reports of fraud and election irregularities were untrue.Ó They argued that Òhundreds of years of history and traditionÓ show that itÕs unreasonable for prosecutors or judges to decide the presidentÕs motivations.\n",
      "TrumpÕs actions Òare within the ambit of his office, and he is absolutely immune from prosecution,Ó TrumpÕs lawyers wrote in the court filing, citing a 1982 Supreme Court decision that involved former President Richard Nixon.\n",
